# Introduction

Empires in space started as a spare time project in 2009. It always stayed a side project and did not get the attention that the idea behind it deserves.
I teach programming as a free lancer and just like to explain programming stuff, so I'm writing this book to explain the ideas behind the scene.

This book is for beginners with some knowledge. You should know what object oriented programming is and have a vague idea of sql. 
I try to explain all other aspects. These are among other things:

* Three tiers architecture (SQL, WebServer, Client) including setup on your machine
* SQL data structures
* Thread safe programming
* In memory data representation
* Quad trees
* LINQ
* Async/AWait
* Game Map Generation
* Bulk data insert into the database and why to use it
* Interfaces
* Saving Passwords with salt and hash
* WebSockets using SignalR
* Creating big typescript single page applications
* Using the HTML canvas to draw elements 
* Minimizing Javascript with closure compiler and Advanced optimization
* Unit testing

This is a wild mix of theory (e.g. three tier architecture), implementation descriptions (e.g. Game Map Generation ) and programming examples (e.G. LINQ).
I would love to be contacted when something is unclear or incorrect. You might want to use the github issues to do so. 
Feel also free to contact me. If nobody is interested in this book, I will not continue it after a few chapters.
