# Introduction

Empires in space started as a spare time project in 2009. It always stayed a side project and did not get the attention that the idea behind it deserves.
I teach programming as a free lancer and just like to explain programming stuff, so I'm writing this book to explain the ideas behind the scene.

Used languages are: C#, Javascript, Typescript, SQL, HTML, CSS
Tools: Visual Studio 2019 Community (including the Database), optionally Inkscape (only if you want to read a bit about the creation of vector graphics), a web browser of your choice which has developer tools (the major ones have those)

This book is for beginners with some knowledge - you should know what object oriented programming is and have a vague idea of sql. 
I try to explain all other aspects. These are among other things:

* Three tiers architecture (SQL, WebServer, Client) including setup on your machine
* SQL data structures
* Thread safe programming
* In memory data representation
* Quad trees
* LINQ
* Async/AWait
* Game Map Generation
* Bulk data insert into the database and why to use it
* Interfaces
* Saving Passwords with salt and hash
* WebSockets using SignalR
* Creating big typescript single page applications
* Using the HTML canvas to draw elements 
* Minimizing Javascript with closure compiler and Advanced optimization
* Unit testing

This is a wild mix of theory (e.g. three tier architecture), implementation descriptions (e.g. Game Map Generation ) and programming examples (e.G. LINQ).
I would love to be contacted when something is unclear or incorrect. You might want to use the github issues to do so, send an email to admin@empiresinspace.com or write into the ingame chat (if you have an account in empires in space).
